# BEA Calculator - Web Version ✅ COMPLETED

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **BEA Calculator** is a completed standalone web application that successfully demonstrates how emotions can be treated as computational data and processed using pure mathematical operations. This project showcases **Behavioral Emotional Architecture (BEA)**, a patent-protected framework that transforms abstract emotional concepts into concrete, mathematically computable entities using authentic 1 ⊕ 1 ≠ 3 emergence principles.

## 🧠 What It Does

### Core Concept
An interactive calculator that treats emotions like numbers in a mathematical equation, built on the foundational BEA principle that **1 ⊕ 1 ≠ 3** - where emotional combinations create emergent outcomes that transcend simple addition. Instead of adding `2 + 3 = 5`, users can combine emotional states like `Curiosity ≠ Engagement ≠ Elevation` and discover how different emotions interact, transform, and influence each other through symbolic emergence.

### Key Innovation
**Emotions as Data Structures**: Each emotional state (E[0] through E[31]) is a computational entity with properties like intensity level, visual characteristics, and interaction weights. This allows for predictable, repeatable emotional calculations.

**Pure Mathematical Implementation**: All emotional combinations use authentic BEA formulas:
- **Combust (⊕)**: `(a + b) % 32` - modulo arithmetic creating emergent outcomes
- **Resonant Contrast (≠)**: `(16 + |a - b|) % 32` - tension-based emergence in ascension layer
- **Balance (⊖)**: `floor((a + b) / 2)` - mathematical averaging for equilibrium
- **Dissolve (⊗)**: `max(min(a,b) - 1, 0)` - reduction with bounds checking
- **Amplify (⨀)**: `min(max(a,b) + 2, 31)` - intensification with bounds checking

No hard-coded results exist - every outcome emerges naturally from these mathematical principles.
